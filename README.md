# Pocket Community

This repo contains source code for a website dedicated to any community (aka citizens of a state). Purpose of the platform is to provide unobstructed communication and participation of every member of the community.

Platform is written in `TypeScript` using `SvelteKit`.

> [!NOTE]  
> Platform isn't dedicated to political parties **nor anyhow connected to the governments of particular region/state**. Platform authors strongly believe that "modern" political systems are outdated and does not serve the purpose any more.

## Platform features

Platform provides following features:
- free registration
- suggesting community improvements
- voting for proposed improvements (based on majority voting principles)
- suggestion of temporal implementation groups
- selection of candidates
- browsing candidates biographies
- anonymous usage
- open source

For development, [`bun package manager`](https://bun.sh/) is needed. Make sure you have `bun` installed on your machine before running the dev server.

Follow these steps to run the development version locally:

```bash
# to install needed dependencies

# to start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```
